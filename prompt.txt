Issue #22 – Add pre‑mortem entry for POC sprint

## Task

Append to `logs/premortems/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md` three plausible failure
modes for the 24‑h POC sprint and one‑line mitigations, e.g.:

- **Scope creep** – keep tasks atomic (1 Issue = 1 PR).
- **LLM output junk** – run spot checks, merge only reviewed PRs.
- **Time overruns** – hard‑cut tasks at 90 min and iterate later.

If the file doesn’t exist, create it.

## Acceptance Criteria
- New dated Markdown file exists (or appended) with 3 bullet points.
