Issue #16 – Add deck outline.md

## Task

Create `deck/outline.md` with these slide headings and bullets:

1. **Problem**  
   - Politics is a high‑stakes game, like flying.  
   - What if there were a “flight simulator” for politicians?  
   - Many people imagine themselves as politicians and they can play too.  

2. **Solution**  
   - A narrative game that trains politicians—especially political speech, negotiation and decision‑making.  
   - AI factions give instant feedback.

3. **Core Loop**  
   - Player inputs worldview → crafts 60‑word speech → AI reacts.  
   - Iterate to win over factions.

Save the file; no images yet.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `deck/outline.md` exists on **main** after merge.
- The content matches the bullets above.
