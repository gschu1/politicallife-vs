Issue #20 – Add six concept images for deck

## Task

Create the folder `deck/images/` and add **six** PNG placeholders:

deck/images/01_marketplace.png  
deck/images/02_townhall.png  
deck/images/03_faction_symbols.png  
deck/images/04_ui_mock_speech.png  
deck/images/05_ui_mock_reaction.png  
deck/images/06_pitch_cover.png  

For each image, generate a 1280×720 PNG that simply displays its
filename as large centered text on a neutral background (solid color or
soft gradient). This keeps the repo lightweight while reserving slots
for real concept art later.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All six `.png` files exist on **main** after merge.  
- Each file opens and shows the correct filename text.  
- No additional binary files or bloat added.
